## Getting Started
- Get a [Public Access Token from Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-access-token/)
- Copy `config-example.js`, rename as `config.js` and add your access token to the new file
- Open `index.html` in a browser window
- Open console to view test results

## If I Had More Time
- Set up a more complete testing framework
- Refactor `scripts.js` so it's not modifying a global `mymap` object
